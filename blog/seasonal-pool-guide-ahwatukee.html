            <h1>Ahwatukee Pool Care: A Complete Seasonal Guide</h1>
            <p>Ahwatukee Foothills sits in a unique pocket of the Phoenix metro area — nestled against South Mountain with its own microclimate that affects pool maintenance throughout the year. Whether you're in Mountain Park Ranch, Lakewood, or the Foothills Club West area, this seasonal guide will help you keep your pool in pristine condition every month of the year.</p>

<h2>Spring (March through May)</h2>
<p>Spring in Ahwatukee marks the transition from mild winters to scorching summers, and it's arguably the most important time to get your pool in order.</p>
<p><strong>March:</strong> Water temperatures begin climbing from the mid-60s to the low 70s. This is when algae spores that survived winter start becoming active. Increase your pump run time from 6 hours to 8 hours daily. Test your cyanuric acid (CYA) level — after winter's lower chemical demand, it may have drifted. Target 50-70 ppm heading into spring.</p>
<p><strong>April:</strong> Palo Verde trees throughout Ahwatukee begin dropping their yellow blossoms, which create a major debris challenge for pools. If you have Palo Verde trees near your pool, daily skimming or a quality leaf net becomes essential. This organic matter consumes chlorine rapidly and can stain pool surfaces if left sitting.</p>
<p><strong>May:</strong> Temperatures regularly hit 100°F, and pool water temperatures reach the low to mid-80s. Increase chlorine dosing and pump run time to 8-10 hours. Schedule any needed equipment repairs now — once June hits, every pool company in the Valley is slammed with emergency calls.</p>

<h2>Summer (June through September)</h2>
<p>Summer is when Ahwatukee pools work their hardest, and when maintenance mistakes become most costly.</p>
<p><strong>June-July:</strong> With air temperatures above 110°F and water temps hitting 90°F+, chlorine demand peaks. Run your pump 10-12 hours daily, ideally during off-peak electricity hours (9 PM to 5 AM with SRP) to save on energy costs. Test water chemistry at least twice per week. Free chlorine should be maintained at 4-5 ppm — the standard 2-3 ppm isn't sufficient in these conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Monsoon Season (July-September):</strong> Ahwatukee's position against South Mountain means it gets hit particularly hard during monsoon events. The mountain funnels wind and dust directly into the community. After any haboob or significant monsoon storm, your pool needs immediate attention — skim debris, run the filter for a full cycle, and shock the pool. Don't wait for your regular service day; the combination of dust, rain, and warm water can produce a full algae bloom within 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>September:</strong> The tail end of monsoon season gradually transitions to drier conditions. Water temperatures begin dropping slightly but remain warm enough to require full summer chemical protocols through month's end.</p>

<h2>Fall (October through November)</h2>
<p>Fall is Ahwatukee's sweet spot for pool enjoyment — warm enough to swim comfortably but cool enough that maintenance becomes less demanding.</p>
<p><strong>October:</strong> Water temperatures drop into the low 80s, then mid-70s by month's end. Reduce pump run time to 8 hours. Chemical demand decreases noticeably, so reduce chlorine dosing to prevent over-chlorination. This is an excellent time for filter deep cleaning — disassemble cartridge filters and soak elements in a cleaning solution, or perform a thorough DE filter tear-down.</p>
<p><strong>November:</strong> Most Ahwatukee residents are still swimming into early November when water temps are in the upper 60s to low 70s. If you have a pool heater, now's the time to test it before you actually need it. Schedule a professional equipment inspection to address anything that took a beating during summer.</p>

<h2>Winter (December through February)</h2>
<p>Ahwatukee's winters are mild by national standards but still require pool attention.</p>
<p><strong>December-January:</strong> Water temperatures drop to the mid-50s to low 60s. Algae growth slows dramatically, and chemical demand is at its lowest. Reduce pump run time to 4-6 hours daily, but never turn your pump off entirely. On nights when temperatures drop below 35°F (uncommon but possible in Ahwatukee), run the pump continuously to prevent freeze damage to pipes and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>February:</strong> The transition month. Temperatures begin warming, and this is the ideal time for any major maintenance projects — acid washes, replastering, tile repair, or equipment replacement. Pool contractors have more availability and sometimes offer off-season pricing.</p>

<h2>Year-Round Ahwatukee Pool Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage your CYA:</strong> Ahwatukee gets the same intense sun as the rest of the Valley. Keep cyanuric acid at 60-80 ppm in summer to protect chlorine from UV breakdown.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for iron staining:</strong> Some areas of Ahwatukee, particularly older neighborhoods near 48th Street, have higher iron content in their water. If you notice brown or rust-colored staining, use a metal sequestrant regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Mind the landscaping:</strong> Many Ahwatukee homes have mature landscaping that drops significant debris. Trim trees and bushes that overhang the pool area to reduce your maintenance burden.</li>
<li><strong>SRP time-of-use rates:</strong> Schedule your pump to run during off-peak hours (typically after 8 or 9 PM) to save 30-50% on the electricity cost of running your pool equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every season in Ahwatukee brings its own pool care challenges and opportunities. By adjusting your maintenance approach throughout the year, you'll avoid costly problems, extend equipment life, and enjoy crystal-clear water whenever you want to take a dip.</p>
