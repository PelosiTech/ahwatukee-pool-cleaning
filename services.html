            <h2>Weekly Pool Cleaning &amp; Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Our most popular service keeps your Ahwatukee pool in perfect condition all year long. Each weekly visit includes skimming the surface, brushing walls and tile, vacuuming the floor, emptying baskets, testing and balancing water chemistry, and inspecting all equipment.</p>
            <p>Arizona's intense sun and desert conditions mean your pool needs consistent, expert attention.

We adjust our treatments seasonally to keep your water perfectly balanced.</p>
            <p><strong>What's included:</strong> Surface skimming, wall &amp; tile brushing, floor vacuuming, basket cleaning, chemical testing &amp; balancing, equipment inspection, filter pressure check.</p>
